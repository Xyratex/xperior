=head2 Dependecies and additional packages

Xperior directly uses some Perl libraries which could not be included in your
Perl distribution by default. Certainly, it depends on your perl setup and
cannot be generalised for any system.


List of external packages are used by core Xperior libs and scripts (C<lib/Xperior> C<bin>)

    Autodia
    Log::Log4perl
    YAML
    Error
    Carp
    Cwd
    File::chdir
    List::MoreUtils
    MooseX::Clone
    Proc::Simple
    TAP::Formatter::HTML
    Try::Tiny
    XML::Simple
    YAML
    accessors
    YAML::Syck

Configuration checker script C<checkyaml.pl> contains Rx libraries and
has also its own dependencies:

    Data::OptList
    Number::Tolerant

Unit test actively use package

    Test::Able

B<Note: current description doesn't include mongo uploader information.>

=head3 Steps for install packages from CPAN

=over 12

=item 1. Install perl and cpan, and initiate cpan. Often it
already done.

=item 2. Use CPAN for installing  these libraries from list above,
e.g. C<cpan install YAML>

    Autodia
    Log::Log4perl
    YAML
    Moose
    File::chdir
    TAP::Formatter::HTML
    Proc::Simple
    MooseX-Clone
    XML::Simple
    YAML::Syck
    Number::Tolerant
    Test::Able

=head3 Steps for  Scientific Linux release 6.0(should work
for Redhat/Fedora too).

=over 12

=item 1. Create and switch on external repository with external libraries. TODO.

=item 2. Install these rpm packages via C<yum>

    perl-Autodia.noarch
    perl-Log-Log4perl.noarch
    perl-YAML.noarch
    perl-Moose.x86_64
    perl-File-chdir.noarch
    perl-TAP-Formatter-HTML.noarch
    perl-Proc-Simple.noarch
    perl-MooseX-Clone.noarch
    perl-XML-Simple.noarch
    perl-YAML-Syck.x86_64
    perl-Number-Tolerant-1.601-1.noarch
    perl-Test-Able-0.11-1.noarch

and its dependencies

=back

=head2 Make RPM

Sources could be packed to rpm for Redhat/Fedora distros. After
build rpm packages could be installed via rpm command as usually.

=over 12

=item * Make documentation

Just use special utility for generate html documentation from POD
in directory C<$WD/html> (C<$WD> - Xperior  source directory)

    cd $WD
    bin/gendocs.pl


=item * Make RPM for harness and main modules


These steps prepare standard perl module distribution and make
rpm for core Xperior part.

    cd $WD
    perl build/Makefile.harness.PL
    make dist
    PERL5LIB=$WD/lib rpmbuild  --define -ba ${WD}/spec/xperior-harness.spec`

=item * Make  RPM for Lustre tests package


These steps prepare standard perl module distribution and make
rpm for Lustre acceptance-small tests sets.


    cd $WD
    perl build/Makefile.lustre.PL
    make dist
    PERL5LIB=$WD/lib rpmbuild  --define -ba ${WD}/spec/xperior-lustretests.spec

=back

For building own rpm packages for external libraries was used
utility L<http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/>.
