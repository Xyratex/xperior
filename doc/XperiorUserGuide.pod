=head1 Xperior harness user guide

=head2 L<Xperior::Executor::Noop> executor

Xpreior harness have only Noop test executor which could be use for proving
installation and Xperiro investigation. Simple comand line for execute
sample empty tests:

    bin/xper --debug --workdir /tmp/demo --testdir=t/testcfgs/simple --config=t/testcfgs/localtestsystemcfg.yaml --html

By default, t/testcfgs/localtestsystemcfg.yaml use local ssh and user tomcat.
Please add local user tomcat with passwordless ssh or replace user tomcat
to exists user with passwordless login. More about L<xper|runtest> and
its parameters.

Simple check for test descriptor files could be done via L<checkyaml> tool, e.g.

    bin/checkyaml.pl --ydir testds/

Other executors could provide support for different test, e.g.
L<Xperior::Executor::IOR> or L<Xperior::Executor::LustreTests>

=head2 Input/output data for Xperior

Xperior expects on input L<system configuration|"System descriptor"> and
directory with L<test descriptors|"Test descriptor">. After start, Xperior
does checks for nodes and servcies which defined in configuration (see
L<Xperior::Node>). Further, Xperior iterate over described tests and execute
every test. Execution results are stored in work directory in
L<xprerior result files |"Description of YAML test result">.

=head3 Test descriptor

Test descriptor file must be placed in test directory (see Synopsis section).
It must be yaml file and have C<_tests.yaml> end of name..

Sample test descriptor 1:

 ---
groupname        : ior
executor         : Xperior::Executor::IOR
description      : IOR tests
reference        : http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Testing_Lustre_Code
expected_time    : 60
timeout          : 300
cleanup_max_time : -1
iorcmd           : /usr/bin/IOR -a POSIX -i 5 -C -g -v -e -w -r -b 10m -t 4k -o @mount_pointE@/@test_fileE@
tags             : benchmark ior
Tests:
   - id               : test1


Sample test descriptor 2

 ---
groupname        : sanity
executor         : Xperior::Executor::LustreTests
roles            : StoreSyslog StoreConsole GetDiagnostics
description      : Lustre sanity tests
reference        : http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Testing_Lustre_Code
expected_time    : 10
timeout          : 300
cleanup_max_time : -1
#options          :
tags             : functional
dangerous        : yes


    Tests:
   - id               : 0b
   - id               : 0c
   - id               : 1a
   - id               : 1b


The file contains set of tags. Main entity is test, in this sample it
is single element C<id> is C<Tests> array. Every test inherit vales from
common description (fields which  described out of C<Tests> array). A test
can override any field or add new fields. Supported fields divided into 2
groups: common fields and executor-specific fields. See alone executor
specific field C<iorcmd>  in explanation below.

B<groupname>, B<executor>, B<description>, B<reference>, B<roles>, B<tags>
- are common fields. All other are executor-specific and used in executors.


=over

=item *

C<groupname>        - name of tests group. Used as directory for test
results placement.

=item *

C<executor>         - full qualified perl module name which implements
Executor interface.

=item *

C<descriptor> ,C<reference> - self-documentation tags

=item *

C<expected_time>    - expected time for test execution. If actual test
execution need more time this will be pointed in result. Not implemented.

=item *

C<timeout>          - after this time execution will be killed

=item *

C<cleanup_max_time> - timeout for cleanup system for next test. Not
implemented.

=item *

C<iorcmd>           - command for executing, specific parameter for
Xperior::Executor::IOR. C<@mount_pointE@> and C<@test_fileE@> are
variables from system configuration, see their definition in next section.

=item *

C<tags>             - test tags (labels) space separated list, used for
simple test filtering. See also C<testds/tags.yaml>.

=item *

C<Tests:>           - array of single tests

=item *

C<id>               - test id. Obligatory tests attribute which cannot be
inherit.

=head3 System descriptor

B<Warning!> The system descriptor is not ended, it is possible that in
future new test executor will need more info about system.

Descriptor is yaml file, which have 2 parts: C<Nodes> array, C<LustreObjects>
and system wide variables. TBD.

 Nodes:
   - id          : mds1
     ip          : 192.168.200.102
     ctrlproto   : ssh
     user        : root
........................
   - id           : client1
     ip           : 192.168.200.150
     ctrlproto    : ssh
     user         : root
LustreObjects:
   - id          : mds1
     device      : /dev/sda1
     node        : mds1
     type        : mds

   - id          : oos1
     device      : /dev/sda1
     node        : oss1
     type        : oss

   - id          : client1
     node        : client1
     type        : client
     master      : yes

   - id          : client2
     node        : mds1
     type        : client

 #Variables
client_mount_point      : /mnt/lustre/
benchmark_tests_file    : testfile

=head3 Description of YAML test result

Sample YAML result from lustre  C<sanity/101b>  test with comments.
Also can be generated tap and html reports.

Many ideas get from L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol>
and perl test framework based on TAP. Internally harness use yaml part of
tap and also can export full TAP output.
